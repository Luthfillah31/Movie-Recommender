## üõ†Ô∏è How It Works: The Tech Stack

CineMate uses a modern RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) architecture to provide high-quality recommendations.

1.  **Embedding:** The user's query is converted into a vector embedding using a `HuggingFace Sentence-Transformer` model.
2.  **Retrieval:** This vector is used to search a `Pinecone` vector database, which contains thousands of movies, to find the most semantically similar films.
3.  **Augmentation:** The metadata of the retrieved movies (title, synopsis, genre, etc.) is collected.
4.  **Generation:** This context, along with the original query, is passed to the `Mistral` language model via a `LangChain` prompt. The LLM then generates a human-like, structured recommendation based *only* on the provided data.
